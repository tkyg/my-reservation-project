# **GUEST RESERVATION**

## Description
Guest Reservation is a reservation app made for the front of the house of a restaurant. It allows the host to enter in new reservation into the system with the necessary information to make a detailed booking. Information, such as guest name, guests arriving, reservation time, and special notes regarding the guest, all of which can be favorably used by a restaurantâ€™s front end team to provide a successful service to their guest. The app features a well ordered navigation that makes booking easy, and as well as updating a current reservation simple.

To get started with the application: 
1. Navigate to New Reservation, enter an available table number, and click Create Table. 
2. Click on Create Guest, which directs to a form page that requires guest information to Add the guest to the Guest List. 
3. Confirm the reservation was successful by navigating to Guest List tab, where you will find the newly created guest. 

Once a reservation is successfully created, select a particular reservation, and update the reservation by clicking the Update Reservation link. The app also offers an option to delete the booking, which is available beside each guest card, to get the table ready for the next reservation. 

The Guest List and Table List offers a broad overview of the most current guest list, and all the tables occupied without revealing all the information of a guest. A feature added to protect the privacy of guests visiting the restaurant. 

Demonstrated in this gif is how easily this single page application can be used.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
